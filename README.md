### `Issues Affecting Cyber Incidents Reporting`
The main issues affecting reporting cyber [incidents](https://github.com/cyberexpertsng/Nigeria-Cyber-Incidents#nigeria-cyber-incidents) in Nigeria are:
1. **Trust and Cultural Problems**: Nigerian organisations have trust issues with security researchers who find vulnerabilities or get access to company data. Some organisations may intimidate or sue the researchers instead of fixing the issues. Some organisations may also fear losing their reputation, investment or customers if they disclose cyberattacks.
2. **Lack of Enforcement**: The Cybercrime Act mandates individuals and organisations to report cyberattacks to the National CERT, but there is no serious enforcement of this law. People do not feel the need to report these incidents and there is no database of known breaches or how they happened
3. **Low Prioritization of Security**: Many organisations treat security as an afterthought and do not have a dedicated or full-time cybersecurity role. They adopt basic security practices but rarely have a team handling this critical part of their systems1. This makes them more vulnerable to cyberattacks and less prepared to respond to them.
4. **Limited Reporting Channels**: There are limited reporting channels for cyber incidents in Nigeria, which may make it difficult for individuals and organizations to report incidents.
5. **Lack of Trust in Authorities**: There is a general lack of trust in Nigerian authorities, which may discourage individuals and organizations from reporting cyber incidents.
6. **Fear of Legal Repercussions**: Some individuals and organizations may be hesitant to report cyber incidents due to fear of legal repercussions or negative publicity.
7. **Lack of Awareness**: Many individuals and organizations in Nigeria are not aware of the importance of reporting cyber incidents. They may not know what constitutes a cyber incident or who to report it to.
